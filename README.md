# Welcome to my Vim configuration
### One must be honest here. I did use CoPilot Ai to get this as since I don't know Vim Script that well but for now I like it.
### It is useful for my Laptop, I use Fedora Linux. You will see in the git history I used WSL but I was so fed of Windows 11 and for other reasons I will not disclose I now use Fedora Linux as my OS with Debian on my really old PC (about December 2017 or 2018 when I bought it don't fully remember) which I don't use as much as my laptop.
### Unfortunatley I have had to put Java back to 2 spaces since I kinda realised that other checkstyle's are just more stricter like for e.g. the Sun/Oracle checkstyle decided to make all parameters final which is the most unnecessary thing I have seen for a long time. And my University requires a checkstyle for my project and a pipeline with a checkstyle test.

### I mainly use C for this text editor and before you ask no I am not a rust man never used it and don't plan to.
### Hope you like it! Feel free to fork this repo or tell me some good plugins and colour schemes for my work and please give me some feedback!
